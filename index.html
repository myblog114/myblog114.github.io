<pre>
Hopefully, this is 'top-level enough' (above hackmd.io, cryptpad, discord, etc.) ... so I'll be able to 'trackback' to it all the time ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Though again some of the information is more private and is currently in 'agenda' doc/excel' ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ I don't want to split that private 'agenda' doc to 'meta' and 'agenda' ... just attach prices to notes there ... 

[#] Unfortunately, some preamble notes that shouldn't be here (but out of helplessness they are here) (...)

[>] Try to obfuscate longhand paper terms (before a period came (and such will come)) when you need longhand paper like air. And can't because the 'obfuscation problem' ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And also try to obfuscate this website too (because they _will_ find it however you want think differently) (doesn't hurt to be 'too paranoid' in this case).

[>] 'Bonding leverage' && 'Banano burn' ... (if voices just keep 'bleeding out of me' and 'can't stop that kind of bleeding' ... (?))
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ You understand that twitter.com conflicts with <a id="obfz008">'r/nosurf'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz008','J3Ivbm9zdXJmJw==','please obfuscate me!');</script> and inputs into your head an enormous amount of useless noise ... is it worth 1000$/year?
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Unless there's an extreme instance of 'virulent cautistic critic' (and there will sooner or later yes will be (you got nowhere to go ...) ...) .. or some other psyche extremity - do not f*cking mess with f*cking twitter.com and other dopamine sites.

[>] Когда куришь табак то тогда мечтай об [<script name="маленьких беленьких червячках которые будут глодать твои кости">makeQuizElem2('0LzQsNC70LXQvdGM0LrQuNGFINCx0LXQu9C10L3RjNC60LjRhSDRh9C10YDQstGP0YfQutCw0YUg0LrQvtGC0L7RgNGL0LUg0LHRg9C00YPRgiDQs9C70L7QtNCw0YLRjCDRgtCy0L7QuCDQutC+0YHRgtC4','&lt;hidden&gt;', document.currentScript);</script>] под землей ('fingers in electric socket' polarization) ... (which is 'truism' ...) ...

[>] Почему на соседей лучше стараться из-за всех сил не обращать внимания даже если доебываюцца? ==> (и почему вообще нужно писать это сюда в этот список/сайт?) ==> Потому что они например ну как путин все типа вокруг знают что он газлайтит типа фейки там итп иноагенты все там итп ... но в конце концов это 'война газлайтов' в которой они всеравно выиграют типа говоря что 'ахх, мы всего лишь двигали кресла и пылесосили пол и иногда стул слишком сильно стукался об пол ... и мы не знаем че с ним с этим случилось -- нервный какой-то н*хх может его забрать в больницу надо 'проверить' а то типа нервный какой-то начинает кричать как бешенный мы боимся за своих детей (и особенно женского пола) может он им сделает там что нибудь -- терроризирует он весь район -- все мы боимся что он там следующее вытворит с его криками бешенства постоянными -- трясемся уже!) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of 'luck' (?)
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Удержать свою связь с 'рамат авивским' ['immigration precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - 'Я'] пока находишься в этом микрорайоне (там тоже такое есть но гораздо меньше ощутимо потому что поток русских и иностранных туристов и смешиваешься с ними и не 'singled out' 'waaaaay too obviously' (они ненавидят белых ашкеназов и даже на мусорных ящиках это пишут!! Рядом с бензоколонкой на ул. гиссин ... или х/з какая другая причина ... гомогенная среда которая ненавидит 'чужаков' они все с друг другом на балкончиках сидят и это часть их 'тайтли-книт коммьюнити'/'tightly-knit community' (?)).

[>] Relation of 'crypto bonding leverage' to 'ifs' and 'dangeli' ... ==> is that if you ever talk about ifs anywhere then you're a 'guru' and then you'll have to overpay SteveP 10,000$ ... and in case of 'IFS' will probably not 'overpay to an ifs therapist' but rather ban from an 'ifs therapist' because he will consider you 'too diffucult' a patient and 'will part with you' 'gently' (everything is for sale) ... 
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And to bond 'talking/not talking' about ifs with thousands of $$$$ ...

[>] The relation between katrain and crypto? ==> Crypto is needed to shut up and not talk on ifs forums because of parallel between 'Pay SteveP 10000$' phenomenon and 'IFS Therapists Landscape Ban' (which would parallely happen if you 'tell everybody how great IFS is' just like as it would with if you told everybody (['sad'] wink,wink ;) !!) how great 'Stephane' is which would lead you to 'The Guru' aka SteveP and it would not be 'cheap' ...)
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ And with crypto the whole 'airdrop farming' shebang is extremely 'noisy' and 'non-linear' and has 'resting day' 'inner conflict' (is it money or not?) aka though it is helpful in extreme states of psyche -- it 'wants' to be 'minimised' and yet it's 'very difficult' to be minimised (probably to 'bitcoin' and 'rvn mining card') and no 'internet' involvement whatsoever ... ==> And chess/go/baduk is also there as a 'tool' to 'shut up' about the same 'stephane' and 'stevep' and 'ifs' ... as in 'don't give out chess pieces' or give a 'minimal possible' chess pieces to be able to survive the later onset of SteveP overwhelm.

[>] Crypto minimalism ==> Ideally, farming should be achieved with a few mining cards. And no involvement with 'web3' whatsoever.

[>] In crypto chats you should 'shut up' even if it might mean that you lose 1000$ ... -- because the whole point (or one major point) of 'bonding leverage' is 
because you lack (lacked) 'self-disciplining' to be able to shut up about other topics such as 'IFS and Stephane and SteveP 10000$ and IFS Therapists Ban' ... and 
if you open yourself up to communication with some possibly angry and 'unreasonable' mod with whom you might be needing to negotiate 'unban' now ... then you 'set 
yourself up' for a 'hole in self disciplining' which you were lacking in the first place and came to 'bonding leverage' just exactly because of that one problem (!!) ...
(re-read this very paragraph from the beginning (maybe a few times (not trying to be 'offending' here))) ...
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the rule of thumb is - to never, ever talk -- even if it loses us 1000-2000$ ...

[>] Больной факт он, что если у меня нету <a id="obfz005">8-9k$</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz005','OC05ayQ=','&lt;pomflh&gt;');</script> как однажды было ... то тогда всеравно остается тай-чи (или должен оставаться по крайней мере ... или Я опять между стульев. Сам себя провалил туда ... типа собака ду-квон -- собака ду-квон.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ <a id="obfz004">'No-bad-parts frame rupture' && 'Tai-chi kata'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz004','J05vLWJhZC1wYXJ0cyBmcmFtZSBydXB0dXJlJyAmJiAnVGFpLWNoaSBrYXRhJw==', '&lt;please_obfuscate_me_for_longhand&gt;');</script> ...
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Reading fiction book for <a id="obfz007">'incremental reading'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz007','J2luY3JlbWVudGFsIHJlYWRpbmcn','&lt;hidden&gt;');</script> (venting of ...) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Fls books - can read now? Or is there something still in-between? (?) 

[>] Одно дело что Я сам себя затравливаю всеми возможными путями из-за того что не могу найти работу ... а совсем другое дело - это то что на меня 'наваливают' / 'навалили еще в дополнение' conservatorship/апотроптос из-за того что 'я не могу найти работу' чтобы четырежда наказать что-ли (или совсем инвалида из меня сделать? (?))

[>] MRA стабилизирует твою психику тем, что ты получаешь group strengthening - что ты не совсем один эмидст фемнизм легал 'feminism's government-backed nonsense' overwhelm.
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ Но с другой стороны ты не можешь просто учить 'закон'/'legal' (без всякого там 'MRA' итп. (и просто 'защищаться' от 'коварного' феминизма легалом и типа п*х ...) и все -- потому что еще п*ська есть куда в этот орган кровь тоже поступает итп.
[>>> 1.1.1.] ^^ Но с третьей стороны в государствах где нет 'governmnent-backed feminist nonsense overwhelm' -- там есть больше тирании (?) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.] ^^ Но с четверой стороны в чужих государствах у иммигрантов иногда есть 'black swan phenomenon' (tbd1,,) ...
[>>> 1.1.1.1.1.] ^^ Но с пятой стороны sometimes you can 'draw strength' from cults' histories too ... (sometimes) (not bulletproof) (tbd1,, more crypto ...)

[>] [SW_VS_FARMING_1] Last but not least: If you could 'fix bugs' or 'write code' instead of 'airdrop farming' this would be 1000x better due to the simple reason that the 'intelligence bar' to 'airdrop farming' is very, very low and hence it's more of a 'waste of time' than coding anything useful for yourself would be ... (I'm not saying it's a 'complete waste of time' though, because <a id="obfz006">Bonding Leverage For 'Lipton Tea'</a><script>makeQuizElem('obfz006','Qm9uZGluZyBMZXZlcmFnZSBGb3IgJ0xpcHRvbiBUZWEn','&lt;hidden&gt;');</script> is still super-important !!!
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ (tbd1,,)

[>] All that you want is to be able to communicate with your "'immigrating precisely to ramat aviv was a matter of luck' - self" amidst those 'long' gps dives dives dives and ... noise noise noise noise noise noise ... and too much 'crypto noise' -- can also f*ck that up! 'Drown' and 'never find', 'never find', 'never find' ...

[#] Securing Wallets
==> 0x1a2BF...721f ==> Tbd1,,

[#] Faucets before L1 & L2 (at least one faucet, everything else is 'hypothetical')

[>] Current earnings in clicker: 43 clicks,, $3.80,, 2022.10.25 (checking if it even works) ...

[#] What comes after faucets (extemely poisonous daily routine that comes from 'helplessness' and should be skipped to 'indie homebrew' as soon as humanely possible)

[>] Get to 'homebrew' and 'longhand' as soon as humanely possible: 10 startup ideas on paper, homebrew atomic micro-steps, atomic incremental micro-pilots, 
step-through debugging, extreme-security & extreme-privacy self-work,,

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 2: Check if airdrop dates where you should claim are approaching and claim on those dates (bonding leverage).

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 3: Check your current staking ongoings and coingecko (if something got rug-pulled or broken while I was asleep) 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Whether restake.app works properly on my staked validators ...
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Re-ackquantice yourself with status of testnet swaps (from yesterday) ('status check') .. by reading and micro-fixing this doc below. Are wallet swap amt 
statuses in this doc represent real-world situations on respective blockchains?
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Added 'Want' column under each L2.
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Micro fixing the status of L1's preparation.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 4: Checks and micro-fixing of L1s and Protocols. 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Individual twitter checks of 'hot' projects that's about to airdrop soon (e.g. rebus). Not 'binge-twitter'. 
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Microfixing twitters of projects and wallet stats compared to blockchain real world data.
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Do not fret. It should be 2-3 major airdrops a year. No more.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 4: Address existing L1 & L2 testnets (continuity) (micro-steps) 

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ L1 & L2 - come first before protocols (2-3 'major' airdrops a year on the whole of the internets). 
[@ ^ 2.] ^^ Do swaps until 'enough enough enough' ... e.g. sometimes 2 swaps are not enough ... 3 -- maybe enough maybe not ... (depending on a project, etc.) ... 3-10 transactions & swaps preferably spread 3-4 Weeks (Optimism wanted 3-4 weaks spread, Paraswap v2 - now wants 6 swaps).
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Find their bulletin boadrs & forums if possible (discords are 'overwhelm' forums less so) ... from there you can see 'governance' etc.  1 Governance vote is rewarded (Optimism) ...
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ Tracking in a document is 'grounding'! ==> Track which account and how many swaps you made on that account and whether you voted on their governance at least 1 time.

[>] Extremely Poisonous Step 5: Scout for new earn/testnet opportunities ...

[@ ^ 1.] ^^ Never talk in discords (see above) ...
[@ ^ 2.] Check discords & telegrams (where the tendencies are) ...
[@ ^ 3.] ^^ Twitter is the worst!
[@ ^ 4.] ^^ You can spend a whole day like that: on twitter, etc.

[>>> 1.1.] В чем прикол? А прикол он в том, что они да могут тебя 'заткнуть' оттуда в любой моментик (жизнь не удалась). (tbd1,,)

[>] По поводу (^^ [#2418]) ==> Каким-то еб*нным макаром всеравно поддерживать 'связь' с рамат-авивом ... в худшем случае еще раз приходить с виталиком в шахматы и тетрис аттак играть ... чзх чзх чзх чзх ... типа 'beyond headslaps' horrific extreme states -- only 'ramat aviv, to where immigration was a matter of luck' - saves (and even that not sure (till 5 AM) -- and not sure till how more longer (48? 50? (y/o)).
[>>> 1.1.] ^^ So the old game that is like ~ 13-15 years old already -- with ramat aviv's luxurous 4-5-room duplexes -- still goes on! Otherwise - it's hellish hell! No more no less! And very few people know, or care. (?) (^^ tbd1,, obfuscate)

[>] [BT1]:```No new task guys? 😁 ==> 
What do u mean? Did u interact with Zksync mainnet? Arb mainnet? Optimism?
I would do them daily, plenty of tokenless protocols there
Besides there is a shit ton of other stuff like all the lens products, lenster/lenstube/phaver to interact with daily
Zerion/slingshot/bungee/orbiter/rabbithole/quest3/layer3 etc a lot of protocols just to name a few
I could write a list that you couldnt finish in a week 🙂 so much to do
```
